1. What Else Should We Prepare?
===================================

**Essential Components**

* Raspberry Pi 5 Model B

    The Pironman is fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5/4 Model B.

* 5V/3A Power Adapter

    A 5V/3A power adapter is required to power the Pironman and its components. If you're connecting other power-intensive devices, consider powering the Raspberry Pi 4 separately.

* Micro SD Card

    Given that the Raspberry Pi is fully encased in the Pironman, an additional micro SD port is provided. The micro SD card used should have a minimum capacity of 8GB.

**Optional Components**

* M.2 NVME SSD

    The Pironman5's IO Expander includes an M.2 SSD connector for an M.2 SSD. NVMe M.2 SSDs offer superior performance and speed, using the NVMe protocol designed for SSDs and PCIe bus communication. This direct communication with the system CPU offers significantly faster performance compared to traditional SATA SSDs.

* Screen

    For visual access to the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment, a screen is required. This can be a TV or a computer monitor. If the screen has built-in speakers, the Raspberry Pi can output sound through them.

* Micro HDMI Cable

    The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B features two Micro HDMI output ports. A converter cable is needed to connect it to your screen.

* Mouse & Keyboard

    A USB keyboard and mouse are necessary when using a screen for interaction.
