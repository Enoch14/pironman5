Tower Cooler
===============


**Warning**

Do not touch the blades, or let the power wires wrap around the fan, or pull the power wires with force to avoid damaging the fan.

Do not use in environments with flammable gases or any danger.

When the fan is working, please do not try to lock the fan for a long time. If you do so, the fan will burn out due to the high heat generated by the continuous stoppage.

When assembling the fan, please pay special attention to the noise generated by resonance or vibration.

Do not drop the Icecube Tower Cooler from height, as this may affect the balance of the fanâ€™s blades.
