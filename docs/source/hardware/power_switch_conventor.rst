==============================

This is a module that expands the Raspberry Pi 5 power switch to the outside.

The Raspberry Pi 5 features a **J2** jumper, situated between the RTC battery connector and the board edge. This breakout enables the addition of a custom power button to the Raspberry Pi 5 by connecting a Normally Open (NO) momentary switch across the two pads. Briefly engaging this switch mimics the onboard power button's functionality.

On the Pironman 5, there's a **Power Switch Converter** that extends the **J2** jumper to an external power button using two Pogo pins.
